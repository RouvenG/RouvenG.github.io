## My Unexpected Journey into Legal Tech: 
From Biotech to (Potentially) Transforming Law
The legal sector is on the cusp of a significant transformation, with technology poised to reshape how legal services are delivered. My entry into this dynamic field was, in a word, unconventional. I came from the world of biotechnology, and I became a legal tech founder driven by the desire to modernize what has traditionally been a very conservative industry. This is the story of my experiences, the surprises I encountered, and the key lessons I learned along the way.
## From Biotech to... Legal Tech?!
My academic and professional background is in biotechnology, a field known for its rapid pace of innovation and its embrace of novel concepts. I've seen firsthand how technology can disrupt established industries, driving greater efficiency, improving outcomes, and generating entirely new possibilities.

What initially drew me to legal tech was a series of discussions with a co-founder, a legal professional, who described the sheer amount of tedious and repetitive work involved in legal practice. A prime example is the manual assembly of legal documents from pre-existing text blocks or snippets. This inefficient process presented a clear opportunity to leverage AI and automation. It was the potential to alleviate this very specific pain point that ultimately drew me to the legal sector.

Despite its critical importance to society, the legal field often operates with outdated processes, cumbersome workflows, and fragmented systems. I recognized an opportunity to apply my experience in technological innovation to modernize this sector, making it more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly for both clients and practitioners.

My prior work focused on making complex technologies, including large language models, more accessible to those without a technical background. This experience proved invaluable in my subsequent work in legal tech.
## Bridging the Gap: 
A key aspect of my role involved bridging the gap between legal expertise and technological innovation.
My "aha" moment in legal tech occurred during discussions with numerous law firms (over 70). 

I discovered that legal professionals often assemble legal documents from pre-written sections, such as paragraphs or arguments, rather than composing them from scratch. This insight highlighted a significant opportunity to automate processes and enhance efficiency. Drawing on my experience in making complex LLMs accessible to non-technical users, I developed tools to empower legal professionals to assemble these text blocks more efficiently.

This required strong communication skills, a willingness to learn, and a genuine desire to improve the way legal services are delivered. It involved fostering a shared understanding and facilitating collaboration between individuals from disparate fields.
## The Future of Legal Tech: A Vision for Transformation
I believe that legal tech has the potential to transform the legal industry, making it more efficient, accessible, and equitable. My vision was to leverage technology to empower legal professionals, improve client outcomes, and ultimately, drive positive change within society. I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to this transformation by applying my experience and passion to develop innovative solutions addressing the challenges and opportunities in the legal field.

For those considering a similar path, my advice is to embrace your unique background, maintain an open mind, and recognize the value of an interdisciplinary perspective. The legal tech industry benefits from the contributions of innovators from diverse backgrounds, and your unique experience may be crucial in shaping the future of law.

**However, as with any ambitious project, the trajectory was not without its unforeseen obstacles. In my next article, I will explore the factors that led to the difficult decision to discontinue this project, and the valuable lessons I have learned.**
